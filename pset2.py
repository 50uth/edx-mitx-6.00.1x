# Problem Set 2 - Paying Off Credit Card Debt

## Problem 1 - Paying the Minimum
## Write a program to calculate the credit card balance after one year
## if a person only pays the minimum monthly payment required by the
## credit card company each month.




## Problem 2 - Paying Debt Off in a Year
# Now write a program that calculates the minimum fixed monthly payment
# needed in order pay off a credit card balance within 12 months.
# By a fixed monthly payment, we mean a single number which does
# not change each month, but instead is a constant amount that will
# be paid each month.



## Problem 3 - Using Bisection Search to Make the Program Faster
# How can we calculate a more accurate fixed monthly payment than we
# did in Problem 2 without running into the problem of slow code?
# We can make this program run faster using a technique introduced in 
# lecture - bisection search!
